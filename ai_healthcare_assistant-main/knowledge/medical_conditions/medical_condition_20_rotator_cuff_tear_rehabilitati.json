  "content": "Rotator cuff tears involve damage to the tendons connecting the shoulder muscles to the humerus. Treatment depends on tear size, patient age, and activity level. Conservative management includes rest, NSAIDs, steroid injections, and physical therapy focusing on progressive strengthening. Surgical repair is recommended for complete tears, young patients, or when conservative measures fail. Rehabilitation post-surgery typically takes 4-6 months.",
