  "content": "Meniscal tears are common knee injuries that can cause pain, swelling, and mechanical symptoms. Management depends on tear type, location, and patient characteristics. Small, peripheral tears may heal with conservative treatment including RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) and physical therapy. Larger or symptomatic tears may require arthroscopic repair or partial meniscectomy, followed by rehabilitation to restore knee function.",
