  "title": "Gout Management Guidelines",
  "content": "Gout is an inflammatory arthritis caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in joints. Acute attacks are treated with NSAIDs, colchicine, or corticosteroids. Long-term management focuses on urate-lowering therapy, typically with allopurinol or febuxostat, targeting serum urate levels below 6 mg/dL. Lifestyle modifications include weight management, limiting high-purine foods, and reducing alcohol intake, particularly beer.",
