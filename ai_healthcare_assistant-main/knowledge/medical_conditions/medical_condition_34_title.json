  "content": "Vertebral compression fractures often occur in the setting of osteoporosis. Acute management includes pain control, limited bed rest, and possibly bracing. Most fractures heal within 6-8 weeks with conservative treatment. Vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty may be considered for painful fractures not responding to conservative measures. Underlying osteoporosis should be treated to prevent future fractures.",
