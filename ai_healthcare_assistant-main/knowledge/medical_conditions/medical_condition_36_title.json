  "content": "Bursitis involves inflammation of bursae, the fluid-filled sacs cushioning tendons, bones, and muscles. Treatment includes rest, ice, compression, and NSAIDs for acute cases. Activity modification and mechanical corrections (proper footwear, ergonomic adjustments) address underlying causes. Aspiration and corticosteroid injection may be indicated for significant effusions or pain. Septic bursitis requires antibiotic therapy and often surgical drainage.",
