  "content": "Scoliosis management depends on curve magnitude, skeletal maturity, and progression risk. Observation is appropriate for minor curves (<25°). Bracing is indicated for moderate curves (25-45°) in skeletally immature patients. Specific physical therapy methods may help with pain and posture. Surgical correction is considered for severe curves (>45-50°), progressive deformity despite bracing, or significant pain/functional limitation.",
