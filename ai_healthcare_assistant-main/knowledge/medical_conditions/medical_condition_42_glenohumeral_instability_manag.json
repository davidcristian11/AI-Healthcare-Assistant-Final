  "content": "Glenohumeral instability ranges from subluxation to dislocation of the shoulder joint. First-time dislocations are typically managed with brief immobilization followed by rehabilitation. Recurrent instability may require surgical intervention, with options including arthroscopic Bankart repair or open procedures depending on patient factors and instability pattern. Post-operative rehabilitation progressively restores range of motion, strength, and function.",
