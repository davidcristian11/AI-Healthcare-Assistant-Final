  "content": "Chondromalacia patellae involves softening and degeneration of patellar cartilage. Treatment focuses on quadriceps strengthening, particularly vastus medialis obliquus, to improve patellar tracking. Hip strengthening, especially abductors and external rotators, address biomechanical contributors. Patellar taping techniques may reduce pain during exercise. Activity modification with reduction of high-impact activities is recommended during rehabilitation.",
