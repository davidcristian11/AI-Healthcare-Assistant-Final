  "content": "Muscle strains involve varying degrees of muscle fiber disruption. Management follows a phase-based approach: acute phase with PRICE (protection, rest, ice, compression, elevation); sub-acute phase with gentle stretching and isometric exercises; rehabilitation phase with progressive strengthening and functional training; and return to activity phase with sport-specific conditioning. Rehabilitation timing depends on strain severity and location.",
