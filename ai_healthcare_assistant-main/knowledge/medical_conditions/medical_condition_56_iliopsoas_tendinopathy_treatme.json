  "content": "Iliopsoas tendinopathy presents with anterior hip pain exacerbated by hip flexion. Management includes activity modification, stretching of the iliopsoas complex, and strengthening of core and hip stabilizers. Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection may provide relief for recalcitrant cases. Surgical release is rarely indicated but may be considered for internal snapping hip syndrome when conservative measures fail.",
