  "content": "Subacromial impingement syndrome involves compression of subacromial structures during arm elevation. Treatment focuses on posterior capsule stretching, rotator cuff and scapular stabilizer strengthening, and activity modification. Subacromial corticosteroid injection provides short-term relief. For persistent cases despite 3-6 months of conservative care, arthroscopic subacromial decompression may be considered after thorough evaluation of rotator cuff integrity.",
