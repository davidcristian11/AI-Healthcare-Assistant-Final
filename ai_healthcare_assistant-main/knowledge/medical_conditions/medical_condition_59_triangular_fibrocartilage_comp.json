  "content": "Triangular fibrocartilage complex injuries cause ulnar-sided wrist pain. Conservative management includes immobilization, NSAIDs, and gradual strengthening. Stable peripheral tears may heal with immobilization. Unstable or central tears unresponsive to conservative treatment may require arthroscopic debridement or repair. Post-operative protection for 4-6 weeks followed by progressive rehabilitation restores wrist motion, strength, and function.",
