  "content": "Coccydynia (tailbone pain) typically follows direct trauma. Conservative management includes sitting modifications (donut cushions, wedge cushions), manual therapy including intrarectal manipulation for mobile coccyx, and local analgesic or corticosteroid injections. Most cases resolve within 6-12 months. Surgical coccygectomy is reserved for severe, disabling pain refractory to conservative management for at least 6 months.",
