  "content": "Femoroacetabular impingement involves abnormal contact between the femoral head and acetabulum. Non-operative management includes activity modification, NSAIDs, and physical therapy focusing on core strengthening and hip mobility without exacerbating impingement. Intra-articular corticosteroid injection provides diagnostic and therapeutic value. Arthroscopic surgery addressing bony abnormalities and labral pathology is considered for persistent symptoms despite conservative care.",
