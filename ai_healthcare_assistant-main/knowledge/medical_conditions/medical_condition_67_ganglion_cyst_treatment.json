  "content": "Ganglion cysts are fluid-filled outpouchings from joint capsules or tendon sheaths, commonly at the wrist. Asymptomatic cysts require no treatment. For painful cysts, aspiration provides temporary relief with high recurrence rates. Surgical excision has lower recurrence (5-15%) but carries risks of scarring, stiffness, and neurovascular injury. Post-operative rehabilitation focuses on restoring range of motion and strength.",
