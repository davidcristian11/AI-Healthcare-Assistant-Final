  "content": "Heart failure management aims to reduce symptoms, prevent hospitalizations, and improve survival. Evidence-based therapies for HFrEF include ACE inhibitors/ARBs/ARNI, beta-blockers, MRAs, and SGLT2 inhibitors. Device therapy (ICD, CRT) is considered based on ejection fraction and QRS duration. Diuretics provide symptom relief but do not improve survival. Patient education regarding sodium restriction and fluid management is essential.",
