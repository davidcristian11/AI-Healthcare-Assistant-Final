  "title": "Hypothyroidism Management Guidelines",
  "content": "Hypothyroidism is treated with levothyroxine replacement therapy, dosed according to body weight and adjusted based on TSH levels. Initial dosing is typically 1.6 mcg/kg/day, with lower doses for elderly patients or those with cardiovascular disease. TSH monitoring every 4-8 weeks during dose adjustment and then annually once stable is recommended. Medication should be taken consistently, preferably on an empty stomach, to maintain steady hormone levels.",
