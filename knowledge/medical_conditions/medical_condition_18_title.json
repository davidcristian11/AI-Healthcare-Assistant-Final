  "title": "Lumbar Disc Herniation Management",
  "content": "Lumbar disc herniation occurs when the inner nucleus of an intervertebral disc protrudes through the outer annulus, often compressing nerve roots. Conservative management includes rest, physical therapy, and pain management. Most cases resolve within 6-12 weeks without surgery. Surgical intervention may be indicated for severe or persistent neurological symptoms, cauda equina syndrome, or cases unresponsive to conservative treatment.",
