  "content": "Temporomandibular joint disorders involve dysfunction of the jaw joint and surrounding muscles. Initial management includes soft diet, jaw rest, heat/cold therapy, and NSAIDs. Physical therapy with specific exercises and manual techniques can improve function. Occlusal splints may reduce nocturnal bruxism. For refractory cases, intra-articular injections, arthrocentesis, or rarely surgery may be considered after comprehensive evaluation.",
