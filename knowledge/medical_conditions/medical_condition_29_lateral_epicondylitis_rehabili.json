  "content": "Lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow) is a tendinopathy affecting the common extensor tendon. Treatment includes activity modification, eccentric strengthening exercises, and counterforce bracing. Corticosteroid injections provide short-term relief but may increase recurrence. Evidence supports the use of platelet-rich plasma injections for chronic cases. Surgical intervention is rarely needed and reserved for cases failing 6-12 months of conservative care.",
