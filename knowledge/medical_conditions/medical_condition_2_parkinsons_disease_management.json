  "content": "Parkinson's disease management is symptomatic, focusing on motor and non-motor manifestations. Levodopa remains the most effective treatment for motor symptoms, with dosing schedules individualized to minimize motor fluctuations. Additional pharmacological options include dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, and COMT inhibitors. Deep brain stimulation is considered for medication-refractory motor fluctuations or tremor. Management of non-motor symptoms is equally important for quality of life.",
