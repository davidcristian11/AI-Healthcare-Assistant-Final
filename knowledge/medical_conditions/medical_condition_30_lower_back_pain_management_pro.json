  "content": "Non-specific lower back pain affects up to 80% of adults at some point. Acute management includes remaining active within pain limits, avoiding bed rest, and using analgesics appropriately. Physical therapy focusing on core strengthening and flexibility is beneficial for chronic cases. Psychological approaches including cognitive behavioral therapy address the biopsychosocial aspects of persistent pain. Imaging is not routinely recommended without red flags.",
