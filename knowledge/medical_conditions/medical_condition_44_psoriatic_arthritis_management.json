  "content": "Psoriatic arthritis is an inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis. Treatment follows a treat-to-target approach, aiming for minimal disease activity. Conventional DMARDs like methotrexate are first-line for peripheral arthritis. Biologic agents targeting TNF, IL-17, or IL-23 pathways are highly effective for refractory disease. NSAIDs and local corticosteroid injections provide symptomatic relief. Management should address both joint and skin manifestations.",
