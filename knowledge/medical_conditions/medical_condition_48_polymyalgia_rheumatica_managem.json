  "content": "Polymyalgia rheumatica presents with proximal muscle pain and stiffness in older adults. Low-dose corticosteroid therapy (12.5-25mg prednisone daily) typically provides dramatic improvement within days. Gradual dose reduction follows symptom control, with most patients requiring 1-2 years of treatment. Regular monitoring for giant cell arteritis is essential. Steroid-sparing agents may be considered for prolonged courses or difficult tapering.",
