  "content": "Tarsal tunnel syndrome involves tibial nerve compression at the ankle. Conservative management includes activity modification, orthotic devices addressing foot malalignment, and anti-inflammatory measures. Night splints maintaining the ankle in neutral position may reduce symptom exacerbation. For persistent cases, surgical decompression of the flexor retinaculum and release of tight fascial structures may be considered after comprehensive evaluation.",
