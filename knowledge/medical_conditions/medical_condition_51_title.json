  "content": "Osteochondritis dissecans involves separation of cartilage and subchondral bone from the joint surface. Management depends on fragment stability, size, and skeletal maturity. Stable lesions in skeletally immature patients often heal with activity restriction and protected weight-bearing. Unstable or displaced fragments typically require surgical intervention, including fixation, microfracture, or osteochondral transplantation depending on lesion characteristics.",
