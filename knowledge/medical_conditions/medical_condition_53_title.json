  "title": "Ankle Sprain Rehabilitation Protocol",
  "content": "Ankle sprains involve ligament injury, most commonly to the lateral ligament complex. After initial RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation), early mobilization is recommended. Rehabilitation focuses on proprioceptive training, peroneal strengthening, and graduated return to activity. External support (bracing, taping) during high-risk activities may prevent recurrence. Chronic instability may require surgical reconstruction of compromised ligaments.",
