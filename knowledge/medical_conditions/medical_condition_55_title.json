  "content": "Whiplash associated disorder follows rapid acceleration-deceleration of the neck, typically in rear-end collisions. Early management emphasizes remaining active rather than immobilization. Gentle range of motion exercises, postural education, and appropriate analgesics facilitate recovery. Most patients improve within 3 months. Persistent cases benefit from multimodal treatment including manual therapy, exercise, and psychological approaches addressing fear-avoidance behaviors.",
