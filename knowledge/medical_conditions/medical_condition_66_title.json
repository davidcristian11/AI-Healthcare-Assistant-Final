  "title": "Spondylolisthesis Management Protocol",
  "content": "Spondylolisthesis involves forward slippage of one vertebra relative to the adjacent vertebra. Conservative management includes core strengthening, hamstring stretching, and pain control measures. Activity modification with avoidance of hyperextension is recommended. Surgical intervention, typically fusion with or without decompression, is considered for high-grade slippage, progressive slip, or neurological symptoms despite conservative treatment.",
