  "content": "Atrial fibrillation management focuses on stroke prevention, rate control, and rhythm control. Stroke risk is assessed using the CHA₂DS₂-VASc score, with oral anticoagulation recommended for scores ≥2. Rate control is achieved with beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin. Rhythm control strategies include antiarrhythmic medications and catheter ablation based on symptom burden and patient preferences.",
